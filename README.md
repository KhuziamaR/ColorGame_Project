# JAVA-SCRIPT
This is a Game I built using HTML , CSS , and Java Script! 
I was inspired to make this exciting project from The WebDevelopment BootCamp By Colt Steel on Udemy!

The idea of the game is to have the user guess which color is represented by the RBG value that is displayed.
The RBG model represents which color you get by mixing R- Red , B- Blue, G- Green light, 
The goal of the game is to guess which color you get by mixing a certain value of each!


To play the game, you can simply download the 3 files:
colorGame.html
colorGame.css
colorGame.js
NOTE * You must have the files in the same directory.

To run the program, you have a few options:  
  1- Double click the colorGame.html File 
  2- Simply drag the colorGame.html file onto a web browser, Preferably Google Chrome
